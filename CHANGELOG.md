# Rome changelog

## 0.5.0

- BREAKING CHANGES: the `format` command doesn't write on disk by default. Now the command prints on terminal.

    **Migration**: add the `--write` argument when calling `rome format`
    
    ```shell
    rome format --write
    ```

- Added a new option called `--quote-style` to the formatter. This option is also available on VSCode.

## 0.4.0

Rome has been [rewritten in Rust](https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust)!

The great majority of the previous functionality won't work anymore, as we rewrote the whole software
from scratch.

Rome, for now, exposes a new formatter that has been revisited and, is way faster compared to its former version!

To install it, use the `next` tag on `npm`:

```shell
npm i rome@next
```
